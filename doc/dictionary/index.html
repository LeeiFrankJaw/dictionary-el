<h1>Dictionary</h1>

<p>Dictionary is a Emacs<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> package for accessing a
dictionary server providing word definitions.

<p>The Request for Comments 2229 <a href="http://www.dict.org/rfc2229.txt">http://www.dict.org/rfc2229.txt</a>
defines a protocol for communication between a dictionary client and a
dictionary server.  The dictionary server keeps several databases
(containing dictionary definitions) and provides an interface for the
client to list the definition for a word and to search for words
matching to pattern.

<p>This software implements the client side of that protocol.  It allows
you to use a dictionary server (for example provided by the site
<a href="www.dict.org">www.dict.org</a>) from within Emacs.

<p>Please note that the dictionary protocol uses the port 2628 which is
likely to be blocked by firewalls.  It is possible to connect to the
dictionary server through a HTTP proxy similiar to the way HTTPS
connections on port 443 are relayed, See <a href="HTTP-Proxy.html">HTTP Proxy</a>.
