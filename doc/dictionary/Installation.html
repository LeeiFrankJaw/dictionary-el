<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>The dictionary client is distributes as <code>tar.gz</code> file.  You can
found the latest version at
<a href="http://www.myrkr.in-berlin.de/dictionary/dictionary-1.7.2.tar.gz">http://www.myrkr.in-berlin.de/dictionary/dictionary-1.7.2.tar.gz</a>. 
Please download this file now before continue reading.

<h2>Unpacking</h2>

<p>To unpack the archive use the following command:
<pre>gzip -dc dictionary-1.7.2.tar.gz | tar -xf -
</pre>

<p>If you have a <code>GNU tar</code> installed, you can also the following
command:
<pre>tar -xzf dictionary-1.7.2.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>A directory named <code>dictionary-1.7.2</code> will have been created by
these commands.

<h2>Installing the files</h2>

<p>There are several ways of installing this package.  If you are a
Debian user you can create a Debian Package for installation using the
<code>dpkg</code> command.  XEmacs users can create a XEmacs package
which can be easily installed too.  Other users have to compile the
package using the supplied <code>Makefile</code> and manually install the
files.  All these installation methods are described in the following
sections.

<h3>Debian</h3>

<p>If you are using a current Debian distribution (one that support the
emacsen package system) and have the <code>dpkg-dev</code> package installed
(for running <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code>) you can use the supplied
debian support:

<pre>make debian
</pre>

<p>This will create a package named <code>dictionary-1.7.2-1_all.deb</code> or
similiar in the parent directory of <code>dictionary-1.7.2</code>.  You can
now install this package as root, it will automatically byte-compile
itself for all installed emacs versions and provide a startup-file
which autoloads this package. In the configuration example given below
you can omit the autoload lines.

<p>If you no longer want to use this package, you can remove it using:

<pre>dpkg -r dictionary
</pre>

<h3>XEmacs 21</h3>

<p>XEmacs starting with version 21 has support for so called <em>xemacs
packages</em>.  These packages are also supported, you can create them
using:
<pre>make EMACS=xemacs package
</pre>

<p>The created package will be named <code>dictionary-1.7-pkg.tar.gz</code> and
stored within the current directory.  If you don't want to install
this package manually, you can use the following command, provided you
have sufficient privileges (if unsure, login as super user):

<pre>make EMACS=xemacs package-install
</pre>

<p>If you have more than one XEmacs versions installed make sure the
<code>EMACS</code> argument to make points to the correct binary.

<p>Please note, dictionary is now part of the official XEmacs package
distribution.  This means you can install this package using the
integrated package management.

<h3>Manual Installation</h3>

<p>The first step in the manual installation is the byte compilation of
the lisp file for quicker loading and execution.  Using the supplied
<code>Makefile</code> this is quite easy, just invoke:

<pre>make
</pre>

<p>in the <code>dictionary-1.7.2</code> sub directory.  This will use emacs as
the name of the Emacs executable.  If you want to use a different
location or a different program (for example, XEmacs) for byte
compilation, use the <code>EMACS</code> argument to the <code>Makefile</code> like
in the following example for XEmacs:

<pre>make EMACS=xemacs
</pre>

<p>If your custom package is not up-to-date expect some warnings about
free variables.

<p>The next step is the installation of the files.  At the moment there
is no support for this step, you have to copy the compiled lisp files
(named <code>*.elc</code>) to a directory within your <var>load-path</var> by
yourself.  Usually the directories <code>/usr/lib/emacs/site-lisp</code> or
<code>/usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp</code> are suitable locations for this. 
XEmacs users please use the according <code>xemacs/site-lisp</code>
directory.

<p>The final step is to inform your Emacs of the newly installed package. 
I added a <code>dictionary-init.el</code> file to the distribution which
contains some <code>autoload</code> instructions to let Emacs know of the
new functions.  You can now insert the contents of this file in your
<code>.emacs</code> or <code>.xemacs</code> file or install
<code>dictionary-init.el</code> into the <code>site-lisp</code> directory and load
it using:

<pre>(load "dictionary-init")
</pre>

<h2>Key Bindings</h2>

<p>You probably want to define some key combinations to invoke the
<code>dictionary-search</code> or <code>dictionary-match</code> functions.

<p>The following example shows the key bindings I'm using myself for this
package.  These are not supplied by this package because the
<code>C-c</code> prefix key together with a letter suffix are reserved for
the user itself.  To activate these bindings insert them into your
<code>.emacs</code> or <code>.xemacs</code> file:

<pre>;; key bindings for the dictionary package
(global-set-key "\C-cs" 'dictionary-search)
(global-set-key "\C-cm" 'dictionary-match-words)
</pre>
